          "**Explanation:**\n\n* Transformation is a process by which genetic material is transferred from one organism to another.\n* In the Griffith's experiment, heat-killed S (virulent) strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae transformed the R (avirulent) strain into the S strain.\n* Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty conducted experiments to identify the transforming agent.\n* They treated the heated S strain bacteria with enzymes that break down proteins, DNA, and RNA.\n* Only the enzyme that broke down DNA inactivated the transforming agent.\n* This experiment demonstrated that DNA was the transforming agent, responsible for transferring the genetic information that allowed the R strain to become virulent.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* The discovery of DNA as the genetic material was a significant milestone in molecular biology.\n* The discovery of transformation paved the way for the understanding of gene function and regulation.\n\n**Relevance to NEET Exam:**\n\nThis concept of transformation and the role of DNA as the genetic material is a fundamental topic in molecular biology and is frequently tested in the NEET exam. Understanding the experiment conducted by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty is crucial for grasping the concept of genetic inheritance.",

          "**Explanation:**\n\nThe genetic code is the set of rules that determines how information from a gene is translated into a protein. It consists of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, each of which codes for a specific amino acid. There are 20 common amino acids, and each amino acid is coded for by at least one codon.\n\nThe genetic code is characterized by the following properties:\n\n* It is **specific**, meaning that each codon codes for a specific amino acid.\n* It is **universal**, meaning that the same codon codes for the same amino acid in all organisms.\n* It is **non-overlapping**, meaning that each nucleotide is used only once in a codon.\n* It is **degenerate**, meaning that most amino acids are coded for by more than one codon.\n\n**Non-polarity** is not a characteristic of the genetic code. Non-polarity refers to the chemical nature of certain amino acids, not to the genetic code itself. Polar amino acids have charged side chains, while non-polar amino acids have uncharged side chains. The polarity of an amino acid affects its solubility and its interactions with other molecules.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nThe genetic code was first deciphered by Marshall Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana in the 1960s. They used a technique called cell-free protein synthesis to determine which codons coded for which amino acids. The genetic code has since been found to be universal in all living organisms, with a few minor exceptions.",

          '**Detailed Explanation:**\n\nRibose and deoxyribose are both pentose sugars (having five carbon atoms) that form the backbone of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The main difference between them lies in the presence or absence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the second carbon atom.\n\n* **Ribose:** Has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the second carbon atom (2\'-OH).\n* **Deoxyribose:** Lacks the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom and instead has a hydrogen atom (-H) attached to it.\n\n**Why is the answer correct?**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between ribose and deoxyribose. The answer, "Hydroxyl group at 2nd carbon," correctly identifies that the presence of a hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom is what distinguishes ribose from deoxyribose.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Ribose is found in RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n* Deoxyribose is found in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n* The absence of the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom in deoxyribose makes DNA more stable and less prone to hydrolysis (chemical breakdown).\n* The hydroxyl group in ribose allows for the formation of secondary structures, such as hydrogen bonding and base pairing, which are crucial for the function of RNA.',

Each strand of DNA is made up of a series of nucleotides, which are composed of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. \n\nThe four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The sequence of these bases along the DNA strand determines the genetic code for an organism.\n\nDNA is found in the nucleus of cells. When a cell divides, the DNA is replicated so that each new cell has its own copy of the genetic code.",

Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied into mRNA.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n* **Proteins:** Proteins are the building blocks of cells and are responsible for a wide variety of functions, including growth and differentiation.\n* **mRNA:** mRNA is a type of RNA that carries the genetic code from the nucleus to the ribosomes, where translation takes place.\n\n**Therefore, the genes are responsible for growth and differentiation in an organism through regulation of translation and transcription.**",

          "**Answer: Nucleotides**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nGenetic information is carried out by DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). These are long chain molecules made up of repeating units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) in DNA, and adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) in RNA. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA and RNA carries the genetic code, which determines the traits of an organism.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* DNA is found in the nucleus of cells, while RNA is found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and ribosomes.\n* DNA has a double-helix structure, while RNA has a single-stranded structure.\n* DNA is more stable than RNA and serves as the permanent repository of genetic information.\n* RNA is involved in protein synthesis and other cellular processes.\n* The genetic code is universal, meaning that the same sequence of nucleotides codes for the same amino acids in all living organisms.",

          "**Nitrogenous bases** are organic molecules that contain nitrogen and are a fundamental component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U).\n\n**Phosphorus** is not found in nitrogenous bases. Instead, it is found in the sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. The sugar-phosphate backbone forms the structural framework of nucleic acids and plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the DNA or RNA molecule.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n* Nitrogenous bases pair up with each other through hydrogen bonding to form base pairs. In DNA, A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. In RNA, A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.\n* The sequence of nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA determines the genetic code and provides instructions for protein synthesis.\n* Phosphorus is also an important component of many other biological molecules, such as phospholipids (components of cell membranes) and ATP (the energy currency of cells).",

          "**Answer: Translation**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe process of transferring genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides (DNA or RNA) to a polymer of amino acids (protein) is known as **translation**. This process is carried out by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm of cells.\n\n**The steps of translation are as follows:**\n\n1. **Initiation:** The ribosome binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule at the start codon (AUG). A specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the amino acid methionine (Met) binds to the start codon.\n2. **Elongation:** As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, different tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA. The amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain.\n3. **Termination:** Translation is terminated when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered on the mRNA. The polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and folding begins to form the functional protein.\n\nTherefore, translation is the process that converts the genetic information in nucleotides into the amino acid sequence of a protein.",
